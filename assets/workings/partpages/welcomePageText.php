                Let the scripts put it all together and print out the finished reports before you set off or as you go.  I haven't managed to directly place your order with your supermarket of choice but it will give a comprehensive list that makes sure you stand a chance of not missing things out.

                I know that cooking is as strange as the individual, and everyone has their own ideas about what should be in a scrambled egg, how long it should be cooked for, and what implements to use to do it. You can change the recipe book (light blue boxes) to make your own meals and allocate implements at will.  This app is to help give you an easy guide to turning your meal for 1 into crates of ingredients, distructions & daily menus to go out to a patrol of 10 diners.
